# feedredactor
a Chrome extension for blocking LinkedIn posts based on keyword


This extension cleans up your LinkedIn feed from unwanted noise based on keywords you choose. I was inspired to make this because I was sick of seeing posts and comments to posts about DeepSeek, and wanted to end that misery. 

When you add your keyword, it will automatically refresh the active LinkedIn tab. Every time you scroll, the redaction agent will scan for and attempt to block any posts, or posts with comments, containing your keywords. 

Note that it will not block images, so you're still on your own there.
